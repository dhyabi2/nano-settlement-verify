"""Verify a Nano (XNO) settlement receipt.

Given the hash of a send block, ask a Nano node whether that block is confirmed,
whether it moved the amount that was quoted, and whether it paid the account the
seller expected. What comes back is a receipt a seller can keep.

Amounts are raw integers everywhere: 1 XNO is 10**30 raw, and a float loses the
low digits, so raw is parsed with int() and never with float().

Accounts are compared as accounts, not as the strings that spell them: one Nano
account has two spellings, the modern `nano_` form and the legacy `xrb_` form.
